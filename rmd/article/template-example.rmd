explaining indirect death

- collectivization makes it possible
- social interventions weakened social ties that insulate individuals from greater hardship 
- social interventions mediate risk of indirect death


north "control zone" with respect to what?


Discuss the method of case selection and classification of cases

- Am I correct that you perform an inference (from interviews) about the level of collectivization in each commune
- do you build this classification before you measured the number of indirect deaths?
- I'm wondering, not accusing you of this, if it would have been possible to collect data on direct vs indirect deaths, and then using this information to affect how you approach the interviews that you conduct





# Style

The question

Some warning that we're gonna be talking about mass killing?

Existing approaches not easy to follow

Discuss what you did, less of how disappointing the results were

- sometimes sampling just doesn't work out
- the thing you need to watch for is whether there is bias
- don't neg your own description or data
- 4 cases, "just going to walk through two of them"
 + vs. 4 cases, I will highlight interesting aspects of two


Flashing a picture from a mass grave

1. maybe not cool
2. not sure how it improved the presentation


map of Pneoe is impossible to read


More signposting during the case discussion

- discussing marriages, punishments

- but not always clear how this is reinforcing a point that you are trying to make
