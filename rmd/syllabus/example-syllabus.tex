\section{Course Policy}\label{course-policy}}

I will detail the policy for this course below. Basically, don't cheat
and try to learn stuff. Don't be that guy.

\hypertarget{grading-policy}{%
\subsection{Grading Policy}\label{grading-policy}}

\begin{itemize}
\item
  \textbf{20\%} of your grade will be determined by a midterm during
  normal class hours.
\item
  \textbf{20\%} of your grade will be determined by a term paper that
  documents your appreciation of Foghat's ``Slow Ride'', the most
  important song ever written. ``Slow Ride'' is what Mozart wishes
  \emph{Don Giovanni} could have been.
\item
  \textbf{10\%} of your grade will be determined by your attendance and
  participation in class. Generally, ask questions and answer them.
\item
  \textbf{20\%} of your grade will be determined by a 20-page term paper
  on when exactly ``The Love Boat'' jumped the proverbial shark. You
  will address whether this shark-jumping can be attributed to Ted
  McGinley, the introduction of Jill Whelan as ``Vicki'', or some other
  cause.
\item
  \textbf{30\%} of your grade will be determined by a final exam.
\end{itemize}

\hypertarget{late-arrival-of-the-professor-policy}{%
\subsection{Late Arrival of the Professor
Policy}\label{late-arrival-of-the-professor-policy}}

My current university, from what I have been told, asks professors to
have policies written into their syllabus about what students should do
if the professor is more than 15 minutes late to class. This seems like
an anachronism. I will inform students via e-mail in advance of class if
class is cancelled for the day. I will also contact our department
secretary if something happened on the way to work. Failing that, assume
the worst happened to me. I ask the students make sure that my story
gets the proper treatment on an \emph{Investigation Discovery} show. I
also ask that my story be narrated by Keith Morrison.

\hypertarget{e-mail-policy}{%
\subsection{E-mail Policy}\label{e-mail-policy}}

I am usually quick to respond to student e-mails. However, student
e-mails tend to do several things that try my patience. I have a new
policy, effective Fall 2016, that outlines why I will not respond to
certain e-mails students send. Multiple rationales follow.

\begin{enumerate}
\def\labelenumi{\arabic{enumi}.}
\tightlist
\item
  The student could answer his/her own inquiry by reading the syllabus.
\item
  The student missed class for which there was no exam. I do not need to
  know the exact reason for a missed class. Students with excusable
  absences are responsible for giving me a note \emph{in hard copy} that
  documents the reason for the missed class. An e-mail is unnecessary
  unless the impromptu absence involved missing a midterm or final.
\item
  The student wants to know what topics s/he missed during a class s/he
  skipped. The answer is always ``you missed what was on the syllabus.''
\item
  The student is protesting a grade without reference to specific points
  of objection. See the policy on protesting a grade in the syllabus.
  These e-mails tend to be expressive utility on the part of the student
  and do not require a response from me. Students interested in
  improving their knowledge of material should see me during office
  hours.
\item
  The students wants to know how many classes s/he missed at some point
  during the semester. I assume the student has a better answer to that
  question than me until the end of the semester.
\item
  The student is requesting an extension on an assignment for which the
  syllabus already established the deadline. The answer is always
  ``no''.
\item
  The student is
  \href{https://www.math.uh.edu/~tomforde/GradeGrubbing.html}{``grade
  grubbing''} or asking to round up a grade. The answer is always
  ``no''.
\item
  The student is asking for an extra credit opportunity, a request that
  amounts to more grading for the professor. The answer is ``no''.
\end{enumerate}

\hypertarget{make-up-exam-policy}{%
\subsection{Make-Up Exam Policy}\label{make-up-exam-policy}}

There are \textbf{NO} make-ups for missed exams. Don't bother asking.

\hypertarget{academic-dishonesty-policy}{%
\subsection{Academic Dishonesty
Policy}\label{academic-dishonesty-policy}}

Don't cheat. Don't be that guy. Yes, you. You know exactly what I'm
talking about too.

\hypertarget{disabilities-policy}{%

Federal law mandates the provision of services at the university-level
to qualified students with disabilities. Make sure to include all that
relevant information here.
